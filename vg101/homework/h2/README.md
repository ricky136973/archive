# Homework 2

This repo is the homework 2 by `ricohardus.cactus@hgroup-25` for the `VG101FA2020-1` course. This `README` file gives the explanations of the codes.

## Ex. 1

In this code, `try-catch` block is used to ensure user's input to be valid. Only positive integers will be accepted, otherwise `Please input a valid year.` will be prompted and the user will be asked for another input until valid value is received. For (non-)leap years the program prompts `This is (not) a leap year.`

## Ex. 2

**OJ score: `100/100`**

A list of all Pythagorean primes less than 100 is generated upon each execution.

## Ex. 3

Instead of making recursion in a single function, this code implements multiple inter-called functions to handle different situations and integrates them into one function. The description of each function is commented in the code.

## Ex. 4

### Iterative

**OJ score: `100/100`**

The iterative method is implemented as the `secant_iterative` function in the code.

### Recursive

**OJ score: `100/100`**

The recursive method is implemented as the `secant_recursive` function in the code.

## Ex. 5

**OJ score: `100/100`**

To optimize the algorithm, a list of first 35 non-negative Armstrong numbers is predefined in the code. The data is obtained from [`OEIS:A005188`](https://oeis.org/A005188).

## Ex. 6 

**OJ score: `100/100`**

Due to the restrictions of the formula provided, this program supports only **years after Anno Domini**.
